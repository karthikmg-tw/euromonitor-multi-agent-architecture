INTRODUCTION

Scope
Although sales were stagnating in Japan and
declining in South Korea in 2023, a strong
rebound in China helped drive positive growth
in the overall regional toys and games market
in this year. This followed the resurgence of
COVID-19 cases in China a year earlier, which
led to declining toy and games sales amid
renewed lockdowns. Kidults continue to be a
key target for traditional toys and games, with
players also increasingly focussing on genderneutral products to widen the target market.

INTRODUCTION

Key findings
Strong bounceback by the Chinese
toys and games market in 2023

There was a strong rebound in toys and games sales in China in 2023, following the decline seen a
year earlier due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the reintroduction of lockdowns. Chinese
consumers have also been showing a growing appreciation for toys that reflect their cultural identity,
with local players looking to meet this demand.

Kidults will be an important
consumer segment for future value
growth

With birth rates declining in the region’s biggest markets, kidults will continue to become an
increasingly key target for toys and games players, particularly given adult consumers generally have
greater spending power. Faced with a shrinking children’s market due to low birth rates, players are
therefore looking to tap into adult consumers’ childhood nostalgia.

Offline retail needs to offer
experiential visits in the face of the
e-commerce threat

As e-commerce inevitably expands its share of distribution, it will be important for offline stores to
create fun spaces to encourage consumers to visit and spend time. Making visits experiential is
becoming more common, and, as many players follow a similar path, it will be important to
differentiate with unique experiential solutions, as well as orthodox ones.

Video games is expected to see dynamic growth in India over the forecast period, boosted by the
Dynamic growth expected for video increasing popularity of e-sports, which is, in turn, supporting the uptake of mobile gaming among
games sales in India
users. Other factors, such as rising smartphone penetration and the availability of cheap
smartphones/data plans, are also expected to boost demand.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Video games continue expanding their share of overall toys and games sales
Video games sales, which overtook those
of traditional toys and games back in 2011
in Asia Pacific, are now more than three
times higher.
Within video games software, which
dominates overall toys and games sales,
mobile gaming is accounting for close to
three quarters of sales in the region.
With the ubiquity of smartphones across
the region, mobile gaming will continue to
grow in the coming years.
Asia Pacific has the highest video games
sales among the seven regions globally,
and is behind only North America for
traditional toys and games sales, having
recently overtaken Western Europe.

However, in per capita spend terms, Asia
Pacific is fourth regionally for video games
and sixth for traditional toys and games.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Asia Pacific remains the biggest regional toys and games market
Asia Pacific is the biggest regional market
for toys and games sales.
After the Asia Pacific performance in 2022
was negatively impacted by surging
Omicron cases in China, it saw the second
highest regional growth rate in 2023.
Over 2018-2023 as a whole, Asia Pacific
registered the highest sales CAGR,
accounting for just over half of all new
value sales globally in this period.
Asia Pacific’s per capita spend is below the
global average and sixth regionally.
However, it recorded the highest CAGR in
terms of per capita spend in 2018-2023.
While the region’s CAGRs will be less
dynamic over the forecast period – fifth for
both sales and per capita spend among the
regions – Asia Pacific will generate almost
half of the expected new sales globally
over 2023-2028.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Asia Pacific returns to recording positive growth in 2023 after the dip in sales in 2022
Many countries enjoyed a boost to the
toys and games performance in 2020 when
the pandemic first hit the region.
The resurgence of COVID-19 case numbers
in 2022 in China, the region’s dominant
market, led to regional decline in this year.
However, a strong Chinese rebound in
2023 helped drive positive growth in Asia
Pacific as a whole, despite stagnating sales
in Japan and a decline in South Korea.
Positive growth is expected to continue
being seen through 2028, with India and
Indonesia, countries with low per capita
spend, most dynamic.
South Korea will return to seeing positive
growth in the coming years, with only
Japan expected to record a declining CAGR
over the forecast period, although its sales
in 2028 will still be above their prepandemic levels.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Video games strongly outselling traditional toys in games in Asia Pacific
Video games outperformed traditional toys
and games over 2018-2023, helping
further widen the gap between the sales in
the two main categories in Asia Pacific.
Video games sales are generally at least
twice as high across the region, reaching
almost four times greater in China.
In spite of a double-digit decline in real
value terms in 2023, video games sales
were still more than six times greater than
traditional toys and games sales in South
Korea at the end of the review period.
Within video games, mobile games
account for more than two thirds of sales
in the overall region.
As cross-platform games continue
emerging, this will provide additional sales
opportunities for mobile games – such as
expanding into computer games and
console games.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Games and puzzles still seeing dynamic growth in Japan in 2023
Games and puzzles recorded another year
of very strong growth in Japan in 2023.
Now by some way the biggest category in
traditional toys and games in Japan, its
dynamic performance helped overall
traditional toys and games record positive
growth in 2023, despite many other
categories being in decline in this year.
In particular, sales of trading card games,
led by Pokémon cards, have been growing
rapidly over the last few years.
While Pokémon cards have been at the
centre of this boom, it has not been the
only brand to see success.
Other long-selling brands, such as Yu-GiOh!, Duel Masters or Weiß Schwarz, as
well as newcomers, such as One Piece
Card Game, have also been supporting the
momentum in games and puzzles in the
Japanese market.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Chinese toys and games sales record a strong rebound in 2023
Following the decline recorded in 2022 due to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases and consequent lockdowns, China registered a strong
rebound in its toys and games sales in real value terms in 2023, with growth for both traditional toys and games and video games. The
lifting of lockdown policies facilitated the rapid restoration of offline business, which positively impacted toys and games.
Moreover, with the normalisation of work and life routines, there was a partial rebound in consumer confidence. Despite persistent
uncertainties surrounding the economy and personal incomes, consumers, especially in the younger generations, allocated more funds to
toys and games, driven by a desire to relieve stress and emotional strain.
Most categories within traditional toys and games recorded healthy growth in 2023. However, baby and infant faced challenges due to
changes in China’s population structure, including the continued decline in the birth rate, making it the only category within traditional toys
and games to record declining value sales in 2023.
In 2022, due to pandemic lockdown policies, consumer confidence in spending on gaming was shaken, leading to a decline in retail value
sales of video games. However, with the lifting of all lockdown policies at the end of 2022, the category enjoyed a strong recovery in 2023.
Consumer confidence in spending on gaming rebounded, and the normal issuance of game licences also helped drive growth momentum.
In terms of category performances, after a decline in 2022, mobile games recorded a strong double-digit growth rate in 2023, with its share
of overall video games increasing to more than 70%.
With the normalisation of the issuing of game licences in 2023, new games entered the market, providing momentum for the growth of
video games in retail value terms. However, the user growth rate of video games has gradually slowed down, making the competition in the
category increasingly fierce. To stand out in this competitive environment, leading video games companies intensified their promotional
efforts to stimulate in-game consumption. For example, NetEase’s mobile game Justice Online attracted players through promotional price
reductions for in-game purchases, while miHoYo’s new release Honkai: Star Rail also provided players with generous limited-time benefits
on multiple occasions.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Kidults and gender-neutral toys among the trends being seen in South Korea
After a couple of years of dynamic growth during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, toys and games slipped into decline in Japan in 2022,
before stagnating in 2023, albeit with sales remaining well above their pre-pandemic levels. Traditional toys and games managed to record
increasing sales in 2023, helped by the ongoing popularity of trading card games, which drove growth in games and puzzles.
Elsewhere in traditional toys and games in Japan, dolls and accessories saw a sharp decline in value sales in 2023, with its performance not
helped by major brand Popo-chan being discontinued. Growth was mainly seen in categories in which brands were able to capture demand
among adults.
In video games, mobile games was the largest category in Japan in 2023, accounting for two thirds of value sales. The wider consumer base,
including those who do not play console, computer or online games, often play mobile games, which explains the large size of this category.
AR/VR headsets and hand-held consoles recorded the highest growth rates in video games in 2023. The launch of PlayStation VR2 and Meta
Quest 3 contributed to the former, while the strong performance of Nintendo Switch and Tamagotchi contributed to the latter.
After many years of recording positive growth, toys and games sales in South Korea slipped into decline in real value terms in 2022,
followed by an even more notable drop in sales in 2023. Toys and games saw a decrease in sales for several reasons. For example, activities
outside the home began to regain popularity after the pandemic, while consumers were shifting their attention to various other forms of
entertainment, including OTT services.
South Korea’s low birth rate also impacted traditional toys and games as a whole, with the decline in the population of children resulting in
an increasing focus among traditional toys and games players on the kidults segment in South Korea, with players and retailers looking to
add adults to their target consumer group.
The blurring distinction between boys’ and girls’ toys is also becoming a notable trend, as awareness of gender equality increases. More
gender-neutral toys are being released to cater to a diverse audience. For example, LEGO launched five new series aimed at both boys and
girls in March 2024, including Animal Crossing, Friends and Disney, as it makes efforts to increase sales among girls.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

E-commerce the dominant channel for sales of toys and games

REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Most video games sales, particularly software, are made through the online channel
It is something of a tale of two categories in terms of toys and games retail distribution. In video games, e-commerce is completely
dominant, holding a 90% share regionally. In traditional toys and games, while e-commerce is also the biggest individual channel (35%),
traditional toys and games stores (23%) are still an important contributor to sales, with retail offline still holding an overall 66% share,
mostly via non-grocery retailers (50%) as a whole and grocery retailers combined (14%).
Growth in retail sales of traditional toys and games in China in 2023 mainly stemmed from a resurgence in sales in offline channels, with
consumers more willing to visit physical stores to experience and purchase toys post-pandemic. Overall sales of traditional toys and games
through retail e-commerce channels declined, but on certain specific retail e-commerce platforms, such as Douyin, sales of traditional toys
and games continued to grow. This was primarily due to the rapid development of China’s live streaming e-commerce model, and the
powerful dissemination effects of the Douyin platform.
While e-commerce accounts for 83% of overall toys and games sales in China, rising to a 94% share in video games, these figures are 90%
and 98% in South Korea. Consumers in South Korea also increasingly favour this channel for their traditional toys and games, due to the
convenience of shopping from home, competitive pricing and wide selection of products. However, there is seen as being some potential
for convenience retail and general merchandise stores to emerge as new channels for traditional toys and games. These stores offer
excellent accessibility, particularly for children, who often visit them after school. In addition, they are enhancing their product offerings,
making them promising distribution channels for the future.
After e-commerce (59%), appliances and electronics specialists (14%) make up the next biggest channel in Japan. Appliances and
electronics specialists have been making efforts to enhance their areas for toys and games. For example, Osaka-based appliances and
electronics specialist Edion opened a large-scale store in Yokohama in December 2023, with one of the main selling points of the new store
being the floor selling toys. It has special areas dedicated to popular brands such as Sylvanian Families, Anpanman, Gundam plamo, Plarail,
TOMICA, Lego, Licca-chan or Mini 4WD. The store leans towards experiences, which is a trend for stores stocking toys. It also has a trading
card game playing area and e-sports playing area. The vending channel, in which capsule toys are popular, has also been growing in Japan.

LEADING COMPANIES AND BRANDS

Concentration process slows in China, with Tencent and LEGO losing share in 2023
While significant consolidation was seen in
the Chinese toys and games market over
the review period as a whole, overall
leader Tencent, which heads up video
games, and traditional toys and games
number one LEGO both lost share in 2023.
The sales decline experienced by LEGO in
2023 marked its first downturn in many
years in China.
One reason behind its falling sales was a
lack of blockbuster new products
introduced by LEGO in China during 2023.
In addition, competition in construction
intensified, with the emergence of various
domestic Chinese brands.
With these local players continuing to
invest in product development, this
resulted in increased shares for brands like
Bloks, Enlighten (Qman) and Sembo at the
expense of LEGO in 2023.

NetEase continues making gains in 2023
Of the regional top four, three are the leading
players in mobile games in China, which was
back to seeing dynamic growth in this country
in 2023.
All three were recording increasing sales in
their domestic market in 2023, led by miHoYo,
which continued benefiting from the massive
user base of Genshin Impact as well as the
launch of new games like Honkai: Star Rail.
NetEase accelerated the frequency of game
updates and collaborated with multiple IPs,
including Fantasy Westward Journey, Endless
Abyss, KFC and Sanrio Family, to provide
players with a wealth of free skins and other
items.
To enhance its competitiveness, Tencent
integrated Fun Party with its other popular
software, such as Honor of Kings, Tencent
Video or QQ Music, while also heavily investing
in promotion and advertising.

LEADING COMPANIES AND BRANDS

China is the main revenue generator for half of the top 10 players
In 2023, Chinese domestic manufacturers
of traditional toys and games were gaining
more recognition among consumers.
By developing series of toys with local
cultural themes and IPs, they garnered
widespread acceptance.
For example, Sembo’s construction toys
series featuring Chinese naval vessels and
aerospace technology combined with local
IPs received extensive consumer approval.
This unique integration of toys and
national culture within the construction
category made them popular products.
Alongside traditional toys dominated by
cartoon and anime characters, consumers
have been demonstrating their preference
for products with local overtones when
purchasing toys, showing a growing
appreciation for toys that reflect their
cultural identity.

PlayStation makes share gains on the top two of Nintendo and Lego
At the vanguard of the blind collectables
craze, Pop Mart enjoyed dynamic growth
in the earlier years of the historic period.
Similarly, Pokémon was able to ride on the
wave of success enjoyed by trading cards,
as were Duel Masters and Yu-Gi-Oh!
Nintendo, Lego and PlayStation continue
to head up the brand rankings in Asia
Pacific.
However, PlayStation made major gains on
the top two in 2023, helped by the
popularity of PlayStation 5 in China as well
as Sony’s price reduction strategy for this
product in this country.
PlayStation also benefited from the supply
situation stabilising and accessibility
improving for PlayStation 5 in India, which
saw Sony launch PlayStation 5 Slim in April
2024 as it looked to take advantage of the
booming gaming scene in India.

Cross-platform games expected to provide additional sales opportunities for mobile games
The Chinese toys and games market is expected to see solid if unspectacular growth in real value terms over the forecast period. In
traditional toys and games, construction, and dolls and accessories, the two biggest categories, will be expected to continue driving
development. In the future, the proportion of licensed traditional toys and games and the trend of trendy and collectible toys in China are
expected to continue to rise, while the number of kidult users in traditional toys and games will also continue to increase.
In video games, mobile games, the biggest category, will continue to see growth, and contribute significantly to absolute value growth over
the forecast period. The increasing popularity of online games and subscriptions will also serve as an important growth driver.
Cross-platform games are expected to continue emerging, providing additional sales opportunities for mobile games – such as expanding
into computer games and console games. Cross-platform operations offer players more choices, allowing them to select the best gaming
experience based on their preferences. This is likely to boost their enthusiasm for trying out new games, and enhance their willingness to
make purchases. As mobile games increasingly adopt multi-platform strategies, subscription models are poised to further integrate gaming
resources across various platforms and devices, creating a seamless gaming experience for players.
While games and puzzles, like traditional toys and games as a whole, will be declining in Japan in the coming years, sales of trading card
games remain at highly elevated levels following the very strong growth seen in recent years. Pokémon revealed with DeNA that they are
together developing the Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket mobile app, with a targeted launch in 2024. This mobile app is expected to
extend the boom of Pokémon cards, and may even revitalise sales of analogue card games.
The biggest story in video game consoles in Japan over the forecast period will be Nintendo’s next-gen console. Despite the numerous news
stories already circulating, there is still uncertainty, as Nintendo has not announced any official timeline yet. The next-gen console following
Nintendo Switch could be launched in or around the latter half of the company’s fiscal year, meaning October 2024 to March 2025.
Nintendo Switch was a significant hit, partly owing to home seclusion. It remains to be seen how the next-gen Nintendo console functions
and performs.

FORECAST PROJECTIONS

South Korean companies targeting global expansion in the video games industry
The toys and games market in South Korea is set to return to growth in real value terms in the forecast period. Traditional toys and games
will record growth due to various factors, including new character developments, AI advances, the kidult trend and edu-tech innovations.
AI-enhanced toys provide interactive experiences for users of all ages, catering to the preferences of both children and adults. Moreover, AIequipped toys have the potential to serve as companions for older people, enhancing their wellbeing and quality of life. In addition, AIpowered edu-tech tools offer personalised learning experiences, adapting to individual learning styles and improving learning outcomes.

Video games will also be seeing positive growth in real value terms over the forecast period. In 2024, major South Korean companies were
targeting global expansion in the video games industry. Their strategy involves creating PC and console games tailored specifically for
international audiences, with a focus on adapting content to resonate with players worldwide.
This shift comes as they navigate challenges in the domestic market, such as slowing growth and regulatory obstacles, prompting them to
explore opportunities abroad. With the mobile games boom slowing, more companies are turning to PC and console games as avenues for
global growth. Despite the limited sized of the domestic consoles market, these companies are seeking success in North American and
European markets.
In terms of transparency and consumer protection within video games, there has been a push for greater disclosure of probability-based
items since March 2024. These items, influenced by chance factors and purchased by players for a fee, now require specific probability
information to ensure transparency and consumer awareness.
Video games operators with substantial sales must disclose this information on their websites, categorising items and providing individual
probabilities. To address user concerns, South Korean games companies are expected to reduce their reliance on probability-based items
and explore alternative business models.
